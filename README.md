## Abstract
This project focuses on the **classification** of emails as either spam or non-spam using **decision trees**. The [data set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase) for this project contains a list of spam and non-spam emails with their **attributes** in terms of frequency of certain words and characters. We used 75% of the data set to train the decision tree and applied that model on the remaining 25% of the data set to test the model accuracy. When training our decision tree, we focused on the importance of having minimal false positives as possible (good email marked as spam).

## Data Wrangling
In order match the values in the data set to their corresponding labels, we needed to create a list of column names. The names are given on the [data set description](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/spambase/spambase.names) for this project.
